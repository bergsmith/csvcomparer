Roadmap
=======
**csvcomparer** is in its infancy, and there are high hopes for this project!

The ultimate goal is being able to compare any two data sets that can be consumed as a "dataframe", regardless of size, efficiently as possible. This comes with a great deal of challenges, but I'm confident it will get there.
